summary: "Our laboratory is keen to understand how androgens and estrogens affect brain functions, particularly on how these hormones control mitochondrial functions in the healthy and diseased brain with life span in a sex dimorphic manner. We are currently investigating these research areas:
- The effects of synthetic hormones (e.g. tibolone) on mitochondria metabolism.
- Hormonal signaling affecting cellular outcome, and how important this is for mitochondrial respiration under neurological diseases in presence or absence of hormones.
- Dysregulation of lipid metabolism within mitochondria and neuroimmune response following brain damage.
- Drug design and development of new drugs analogues to hormones for targeting mitochondria"  # Add a page description.
