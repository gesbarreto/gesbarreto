Dr. Barreto earned his PhD in Neuroscience (2009) from the Universidad Complutense Madrid (Spain) studying the effects of neurosteroids on reactive glia with traumatic brain injury under the supervision of Professor Luis Miguel Garcia-Segura. His Post-doctoral training in Neuroscience at Stanford University School of Medicine (2009-2011), under the mentorship of Professor Rona G. Giffard, focused on addressing the role of astrocytes activation following stroke and enhance astrocytic functions targeting neuronal protection. With the collaboration of Professor Carla J. Shatz, also from Stanford, Dr Barreto discovered that both PirB receptor and MHCI molecules are involved in the physiopathology of stroke by regulating astroglia activation and behavioural outcome. Nowadays he is a Lecturer in Cell Biology/Immunology in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Limerick (Ireland), is a member of the Bernal Institute and Health Research Institute from the same University.

Our laboratory is keen to understand how androgens and estrogens affect brain functions, particularly on how these hormones control mitochondrial functions in the healthy and diseased brain with life span in a sex dimorphic manner. We are currently investigating these research areas:

- The effects of synthetic hormones (e.g. tibolone) on mitochondria metabolism.

- Hormonal signaling affecting cellular outcome, and how important this is for mitochondrial respiration under neurological diseases in presence or absence of hormones.

- Dysregulation of lipid metabolism within mitochondria and neuroimmune response following brain trauma.

- Drug design and development of new drugs analogues to hormones for targeting mitochondria
